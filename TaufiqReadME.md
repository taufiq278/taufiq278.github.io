   <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have recently worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others.  In my current role Groovy is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the languages features and quirks (including writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>).
And that's all that the configuration it takes! The YAML format is pretty readable; it largely just works with indenting. Hopefully, after taking a look over the nested sections of data, it's fairly easy to understand how you can modify parts to make it customizable.

You can see my GitHub CV page here. Out of the box, you can configure lots of aspects: custom text blocks, key skills, blogs, apps, GitHub projects, StackOverflow, etc.

How Can You Have a Custom GitHub CV?
It really is super simple to get your own GitHub CV.

Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)
Go to the project repository and fork the repository.
Change the name of the repository (in the settings menu) to {{yourusername}}.github.io.
Edit the /_config.yml file in your repository. It should be pretty straight-forward as to what the links and details are that you need to add.
Visit your new profile page ({{yourusername}}.github.io) and start sharing it!
